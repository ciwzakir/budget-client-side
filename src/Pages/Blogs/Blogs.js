            How does prototypical inheritance work
          </h4>

          <p>
            Every object with its methods and properties contains an internal
            and hidden property known as [[Prototype]]. The Prototypal
            Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add methods and
            properties in objects. It is a method by which an object can inherit
            the properties and methods of another object. Traditionally, in
            order to get and set the [[Prototype]] of an object, we use
            Object.getPrototypeOf and Object.setPrototypeOf. Nowadays, in modern
            language, it is being set using __proto__.

            Why you do not set the state directly in React
          </h4>

          <ul>
            <li>
              When you directly update the state, it does not change this.state
              immediately. Instead, it creates a pending state transition, and
              accessing it after calling this method will only return the
              present value.
            </li>
            <li>You will lose control of the state across all components.</li>
            <li>
              While a React component can have initial state, the real power is
              in updating its state â€” after all, if we didn't need to update the
              state, the component shouldn't have any state. State is only
              reserved for data that changes in our component and is visible in
              the UI

            What is a unit test? Why should write unit tests?
          </h4>
          <p>
            Unit testing is a software development process in which the smallest
            testable parts of an application, called units, are individually and
            independently scrutinized for proper operation. This testing
            methodology is done during the development process by the software
            developers and sometimes QA staff.
