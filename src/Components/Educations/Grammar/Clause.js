        <p> He went there but he could not see the man.     </p>

          Shortcut techniques/ways to identify the clause.
        </h1>
        <h1 className="text-5xl my-5">Noun Clause</h1>
        <p> Noun Clause can be replaced by it. To know the know clause ask the verb of the main clause by who/what/whom</p>
        <p>exits preposition before noun clause</p>
        <h3 className="my-2">Example:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li> I know <span> <u> where he lives</u></span>  </li>
          <li> <span><u> What he said</u></span> is interesting </li>
          <li> Tell me <span> <u> how I can go there</u></span>  </li>
          <li> He asked me <span> <u> why I was late</u></span> (why I was late = it) </li>
          <li> It depends on <span> <u> how It is done</u></span>  </li>
        </ol>
        <h1 className="text-5xl my-5">Adjective Clause</h1>
        <p>
          
          We will see an antecedent before relative pronoun or relative adverb.
          And it will say something about the antecedent. Relative pronoun and antecedent are same person or place or thing.
        </p>
        <h3 className="my-2">Example:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li> I know  the man <span> <u> who lives in India</u></span> (Say something about the man) </li>
          <li> I know  the place <span> <u> where he lives</u></span> (Say something about the place) </li>
          <li> He lost the pen <span> <u> that I gave </u></span> </li>
          <li> The girl <span> <u> who laughed at me </u></span> is mentally disordered.</li>
        </ol>
        <h1 className="text-5xl my-5">Adverbial Clause</h1>
        <p>
          
         To identify adverbial clause, ask the verb by how, where, when,or why. If the subordinate clause start with 
         </p>
         <ul className="pl-12">
          <li>so that</li>
         <li>in order that</li>
         <li> as</li>
         <li> while</li>
         <li>till</li>
         <li>until</li>
         <li>though</li>
         <li>although</li>
         <li>even though</li>
         <li>before</li>
         <li>after</li>
         <li>because</li>
         </ul>
    <p>  the clause will be adverbial clause.</p>

        <h3 className="my-2">Example of adverbial CLause:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li> Do <span> <u> as I told you</u></span> (start with as) </li>
          <li> Strike <span> <u> while the iron is hot</u></span> (start with while) </li>
          <li> We read <span> <u> so that we can pass the exam</u></span> (start with so that) </li>
         <li>Though He work hard, he did not pass the exam.</li>
         <li>He can go where he wants</li>
        </ol>

      <h3 className="my-12">See Carefully:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li> I shall go <span> <u> there where he lives</u></span> Adverbial Clause/ No antecedent remains </li>
          <li> I know the place <span> <u> where he lives</u></span> Adjective Clause because antecedent is place </li>
          <li> I know <span> <u> where he lives</u></span> Noun Clause/ Can be replaced by it </li>
